## Vernacular Web by Olia Lialina

After reading Olia Lialina's Vernacular Web, I found myself thinking about how much designers impact our interaction with everything in the world. Lialina mentions how the early elements of the Web became a "subject of mockery" when professional designers came around. As someone who is interested in UX Design, it's very interesting to think about how the internet has evolved to become what it is today. While reading the article, I could not help but think of my Tumblr Blog, filled with animations, a repetitive background, and a animated cursor. Back then, I knew absolutely nothing about HTML or JavaScript so I used templates. A part of me misses the charismatic personalized pages of the web where people could basically go in without any experience or intimidation just to make something they wanted. 

Seeing how a lot of the pages from over ten years ago are gone, I thought about how our presence on the internet is not as permanent as I thought it was. I looked back at my old tumblr page (somehow I still remember the password) and it has been flooded with fake rayban ad posts. It was also quite nice to see the music player I added and listen to the songs I was into at the time, and looked at the things I shared and had interests in. Overall, I really enjoyed reading these two pieces and looking at how some aspects can still be found in today's trends as well as snooping around my old tumblr.
